# SimplePentestScript


This is a simple pentest script that uses Nmap and Scapy.

(I realize it can be much better but this is the first version)

Here are the thing that it can do...

1- Ping ICMP (A bit slow)
2- Port Identication, find open ports and detect OS of the live IP hosts.
3- Router Detection (Not consistent)
4- Server Detection (Hardcoded websites but can be made random with an Nmap command)
5- SNMP Detection
6- SynFlood Attack for the given IP and port
7- Sniff
